Dear @firstName

We'd like to inform you that you have @proposals.size proposal@if(proposals.size>1){s} with status set to "Draft" on Devoxx CFP.
You must submit a talk for review on your private CFP section, so that the program committee can review and vote for your proposal.

@proposals.map{proposal=>
 - @proposal.title  [http://app-7025f873-e3d4-4c71-b8d2-3f504d2ca2b8.cleverapps.io@routes.CallForPaper.editProposal(proposal.id)]
}

If you don't want to receive this message, you can also move the draft proposals to Trash from the home section.

Thanks!

The Devoxx team
